    "__Scenario:__ You are tasked with creating a simple grading system for a school. The school follows a system where students are graded based on their total score in three subjects: Math, Science, and English. The total score is out of 300, with each subject being out of 100. Based on the total score, students are assigned a letter grade.\n",

    "You need to write a Python program that defines functions to compute the total score, calculate the average, and assign the appropriate grade based on certain conditions.\n"
